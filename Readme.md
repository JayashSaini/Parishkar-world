# Parishkar College Clone Project

This project aims to replicate the website of Parishkar College using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Express.js and Node.js for server-side functionality. Despite not being responsive, it offers a range of features, including:

- Home, About, FAQ, News, and Contact pages.
- Static file serving using Express.js.
- Simple routing for navigation.
- Non-responsive design focusing on functionality rather than layout adaptability.

To get started, ensure you have Node.js installed. Clone the repository, install dependencies with `npm install`, and run the server using `npm start`. Access the project at `http://localhost:3000`.
